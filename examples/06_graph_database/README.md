# Graph Database Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating Threat Radar's graph database capabilities for vulnerability and infrastructure modeling.

## Overview

The graph database feature models security relationships as a graph structure, enabling powerful queries that are difficult or impossible with flat data structures:

- **Blast Radius Analysis**: Find all assets affected by a CVE
- **Package Risk Assessment**: Identify most vulnerable packages
- **Attack Path Discovery**: Trace potential exploit chains
- **Fix Prioritization**: Intelligently prioritize remediation efforts
- **Trend Analysis**: Track security posture over time

## Quick Start

### 1. Run with Mock Data (Fastest)

All examples include mock data and can run immediately:

```bash
# Basic concepts
python 01_basic_graph_usage.py

# Advanced queries
python 02_advanced_graph_analysis.py

# Complete workflows
python 03_graph_workflows.py
```

### 2. Run with Real CVE Scans

For real-world results, scan actual containers first:

```bash
# Step 1: Scan container
threat-radar cve scan-image alpine:3.18 --auto-save -o alpine-scan.json

# Step 2: Build graph
threat-radar graph build alpine-scan.json --auto-save -o alpine-graph.graphml

# Step 3: Query graph
threat-radar graph query alpine-graph.graphml --stats
threat-radar graph query alpine-graph.graphml --top-packages 10
threat-radar graph query alpine-graph.graphml --cve CVE-2023-XXXX
```

## Common Use Cases

### CI/CD Integration

Use graph analysis to enforce security policies in your build pipeline:

```python
# In your CI/CD script
from threat_radar.graph import NetworkXClient, GraphBuilder, GraphAnalyzer

client = NetworkXClient()
builder = GraphBuilder(client)
builder.build_from_scan(scan_result)

analyzer = GraphAnalyzer(client)
stats = analyzer.vulnerability_statistics()

# Enforce policy
if stats['by_severity']['critical'] > 0:
    print("‚ùå Build failed: Critical vulnerabilities found")
    sys.exit(1)
```

### Security Dashboards

Export graph data for custom dashboards:

```python
# Export for web visualization
graph_dict = client.export_to_dict()

# Save for D3.js, Cytoscape.js, etc.
with open('dashboard-data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(graph_dict, f)
```

### Compliance Reporting

Generate audit reports for stakeholders:

```python
analyzer = GraphAnalyzer(client)
stats = analyzer.vulnerability_statistics()
top_packages = analyzer.most_vulnerable_packages(top_n=10)
fixes = analyzer.find_fix_candidates()

# Generate report sections
# (See 03_graph_workflows.py for complete example)
```

## Advanced Topics

### Custom Queries with NetworkX

Access the underlying NetworkX graph for custom analysis:

```python
from threat_radar.graph import NetworkXClient
import networkx as nx

client = NetworkXClient()
# ... build graph ...

# Access NetworkX graph
G = client.graph

# Use any NetworkX algorithm
pagerank = nx.pagerank(G)
shortest_paths = nx.shortest_path(G, source, target)
communities = nx.community.louvain_communities(G)
```

### Graph Visualization

Export graphs for visualization tools:

```bash
# GraphML format (Gephi, Cytoscape)
threat-radar graph build scan.json -o graph.graphml

# JSON format (D3.js, custom web apps)
```

**Recommended Tools:**
- **Gephi** (https://gephi.org) - Desktop, powerful
- **Cytoscape** (https://cytoscape.org) - Network analysis
- **Neo4j Browser** - Graph database UI
- **D3.js** - Web-based custom visualizations

### Migration to Neo4j

The architecture supports future Neo4j migration:

```python
# Current: NetworkX
from threat_radar.graph import NetworkXClient
client = NetworkXClient()

# Future: Neo4j (when implemented)
from threat_radar.graph import Neo4jClient
client = Neo4jClient(uri="bolt://localhost:7687")

# Same API, different backend!
```

## Performance Considerations

### Graph Size

- **Small** (< 100 nodes): Instant queries
- **Medium** (100-1000 nodes): Sub-second queries
- **Large** (> 1000 nodes): Consider Neo4j migration

### Storage

GraphML files are compact:
- Typical scan: 50-200 KB
- Large scan: 500 KB - 2 MB
- Historical collection: Manageable with cleanup

```bash
# Clean up old graphs
threat-radar graph cleanup --days 30
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Graph file not found"
**Solution**: Check file path and ensure graph was saved:
```bash
threat-radar graph build scan.json --auto-save
threat-radar graph list  # Verify saved
```

### Issue: "No vulnerabilities found in graph"
**Solution**: Verify scan results have vulnerabilities:
```bash
# Check scan output
cat scan.json | jq '.matches | length'
```

### Issue: "CVE not found in graph"
**Solution**: Use correct CVE ID format:
```bash
# Correct
threat-radar graph query graph.graphml --cve CVE-2023-0001

# Incorrect (missing CVE- prefix)
threat-radar graph query graph.graphml --cve 2023-0001
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run Examples**: Start with `01_basic_graph_usage.py`
2. **Real Scans**: Try with your actual containers
3. **Customize**: Adapt workflows to your security operations
4. **Automate**: Integrate into CI/CD pipelines
5. **Visualize**: Export graphs to visualization tools
